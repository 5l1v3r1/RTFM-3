# RTFM
Tools used for OSCP prep

# Overview:
1. Framework dir is the main tool, that will help automate common pen testing tasks.  It must have at least libnmap, and the Setup.py script ran alone will install it, but it will install a lot of other things as well, and could take about an hour.  main.py will run the entire script.
2. ToolUpdater is a C# tool used to add new command lines, mostly just a copy of the Kali tools page.
